## What?
This consists of three scripts that can be used to generate NovelAI training data from 4chan archived threads:
- \_scraper.py, which downloads a list of all threads matching a given arch.b4k.co search result
- \_dumper.py, which downloads all threads generated by scraper.py
- \_cleaner.py, which parses, cleans, and reformats the threads dumped by dumper.py

## Requirements
* python3
* BeautifulSoup (`pip install BeautifulSoup`)
* ftfy (`pip install ftfy`)
* requests (`pip install requests`)

## Instructions
1) Search b4k archive for the threads you want to train a module on, then copy the URL
	- Be sure to select Only Opening Posts
	- Your URL should look something like: https://arch.b4k.co/vg/search/subject/%2Faids%2F/type/op/
2) Paste URL into scraper.py's `BASE_URL`, then save the script.
3) Open your terminal and run `python _scraper.py`
	- This will generate a file `output.txt` containing all of the threads matching your search
4) Open your terminal and run `python _dumper.py`
	- This will download the HTML for every thread listed in `output.txt` and write it to disk
5) Create a folder called `cleaned` in the same folder as the scripts
6) Open your terminal and run `python _cleaner.py`
	- This will parse the downloaded HTML files, clean them, and write cleaned text files to the `cleaned` folder
	- This process is not fast.
## Notes
I've only tested it with arch.b4k.co but it will probably work with most FoolFuuka-based 4chan archive sites with no or minimal changes.
